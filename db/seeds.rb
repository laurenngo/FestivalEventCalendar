Their task: to standardize and certify measuring devices of all kinds.

At the convention, she meets the kind, French, tousled-hair Pi (Laurent Stocker,Sleepless Night), and discovers the possibility of love amid the beauty of the City of Lights.

With each performance given, Fluttershy's confidence in herself rises, but she also starts improvising her part, making it difficult for Big Mac to keep up with her. For their next performance at Sugarcube Corner, Big Mac recovers his voice, but agrees to let Fluttershy sing for him one last time. However, Fluttershy gets carried away and exposes herself; despite her embarrassment, her performance is praised.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the episode, Fluttershy joins the Pony Tones as a part-time fifth member, privately performing at her cottage for her pony and critter friends.

The country once known as Japan has collapsed. Out of its ashes an authoritarian party called ANIKI has risen up, controlling the population through fear and feeding them human flesh. The story, however, follows a spy from the nether world, “Sun Ra,” who sneaks into the city; the movie is essentially his report. Themes of chaos and control run rampant, with a doctor and nurse team working for ANIKI and trying to control the sexual impulses of the patients in the psycho ward. Similarly, the control over the movie is often ceded to Japanoise interludes, like a performance from the Fukushima Mutant Gandja Turtles or Toshiji Mikawa and his influential noise rock band Incapactants. Anarchy reigns in both story and style. This is a world where people will return to nuclear power, because six months after a major disaster they’ve already forgotten.

Though only 12,000 808s were manufactured between 1980 and 1983, the 808 has become quite possibly the most influential musical instrument of the last 35 years. Director Alexander Dunn’s stylish first feature charts the evolution of the 808’s musical relevance, tracing how its syncopated rhythms and earthshaking beats revolutionized popular music. Using Afrika Bambaataa’s “Planet Rock” and Marvin Gaye’s “Sexual Healing” as its launching point, 808 shifts between songs, genres, and countries to reveal this unique machine’s impact on the innumerable musicians and producers who fell under its spell. Dunn mixes these songs together with a treasure trove of rare archival footage, ’80s style animation, and interviews with dozens of 808 disciples and devotees, ranging from members of the Beastie Boys and Talking Heads to Pharrell Williams and Diplo. Combining musical knowledge, technical insight, and a genuine enthusiasm for the subject, 808 captures how vision, inspiration, and ingenuity could transform a small device with only 16 Sounds and 32 Patterns into the heartbeat of today’s music.\n", image: "f8tt3umueti4hf8tflaq", video: "lIS-o_--wqY", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/808", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27060", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 107},

Ambitious Assistant District Attorney Judith sees de Berk’s case as an opportunity to make her career, so she pieces together a prosecution based largely on circumstantial evidence. Eventually, though, the real evidence starts troubling Judith, and she discovers inconsistencies in witness statements, even the suppression of lab evidence. But can she turn back the wheels of justice? Director Paula van der Oest might be the Netherlands’ answer to Susanne Bier (In a Better World), equally comfortable writing her own screenplays and directing others’ scripts. She is also renowned for her subtle and sensitive direction of actors, her humor, and the foregrounding of strong, independent women in her work — all qualities to the fore here.", image: "zvx3z5ocdjswhwh5rlao", video: "lcib-3-bags", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/accused-", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27190", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 97},

In the parking spot next to them was Michael David Dunn, a 45-year-old Caucasian man in town with his fiancée for a wedding, who objected to the loud rap music they were playing. Three and a half minutes later, Dunn took a pistol out of his glove compartment and fired nine shots at the red SUV. Jordan Davis was pronounced dead later that night, and Dunn was taken into custody. In the wake of the Trayvon Martin tragedy and the controversy over Florida’s Stand Your Ground Law, the case and legal battles attracted unprecedented attention and put crime-ridden Jacksonville on the international stage.

But after test screenings went south, Miramax sent in a team of editors to recut the film and forced first-time writer/director Mark Christopher to reshoot nearly 40 minutes of material, excising nearly all of the film’s edgier content. Now, 17 years later, Christopher has recut the film to its earlier form—retaining the original film’s moral ambiguity as well as the bisexual love triangle between Phillippe, Hayek, and Meyer that test audiences balked at—wrote a brand-new voiceover, and sent it onto the film festival circuit with nearly 40 minutes of unseen material. 54 lives again.

Over forty years, founder Russ Solomon transformed it from a few modest shelves inside a Sacramento drugstore into a global chain that spanned 14 countries. In 1999, Tower Records made $1 billion. Five years later, the company filed for bankruptcy. To find how this happened, first-time director (and Sacramento native) Colin Hanks starts by exploring what made the store a success in the first place. He discovers a fun-loving company that maintained a tight-knit family atmosphere and promoted from inside, filling its executive ranks with former store clerks and managers. Solomon and his boisterous clan are happy to regale us with tales of their heady rise— and even headier parties— as well as those of their heartbreaking end. Hanks intersperses these employee interviews with rare archival footage and testimonials from celebrity insiders, ranging from Elton John and David Geffen to Bruce Springsteen and ex-Tower clerk Dave Grohl. But the real star of this disarmingly affectionate tribute is Russ Solomon himself. With a raconteur’s gift for detail, he and Hanks spin a story of dreams and drive that just happens to be the story of the record industry itself.", image: "qs2x0w7vjsnotcs21k7q", video: nil, link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/all-things-must-pass", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=26933", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 120},

The night turns into one of smoldering passion, but after Michel disappears with some of her money, she tracks him down and learns the truth: He is a con artist who seduces and robs women. Instead of admonishing him or demanding her money back, though, love-struck Gloria asks if she can accompany him on his next grift. Soon, the two are working as a pair, posing as siblings and fleecing widows, but when Gloria’s jealous tendencies turn obsessive and violent, the game becomes something far more sinister, savage, and psychotic.

As he waits to receive them, he dreams of earning enough money to return home and establish his own business. His more traditional and practical mother, however, disapproves of Abdelwahad’s plan and tries to talk him out of it. Meanwhile, rural life continues, with its slow pace, hard work, and long days.

Featuring soon-to-be Ray regulars Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore in star-making performances, and showing Ray’s ever more impressive skills as a crafter of pure cinematic imagery, The World of Apu is a breathtaking conclusion to this monumental trilogy.

The Unvanquished, also known as Aparajito, picks up where the first film left off, with Apu (Pinaki Sengupta) and his family having moved away from the country to live in the bustling holy city of Benares. As Apu progresses from wide-eyed child to intellectually curious teenager (now played by Smaran Ghosal), eventually studying in Kolkata, we watch the formation of a life that grows ever richer in moral and emotional complexity, in regards to both his studies and his relationship with his mother (Karuna Banerjee).

Your spirit.” So narrates Fettah, a Moroccan fisherman who has set out on a windsurfing journey across 300 kilometers of ocean connecting Northern Africa to the southern tip of Europe. But what compelled this poor man from near Essaouira to attempt such a dangerous solo voyage into an unknown land? What losses have befallen him? We flash back to life in his native village, where each summer he moonlights as a windsurfing instructor to European and American tourists hoping to catch the coast’s famed waves. Still mourning the loss of his late mother, Fettah takes a liking to a repeat visitor’s girlfriend, Alexandra, contributing to a growing sense of confusion about his own life, loves, and family. Writer/director Jan-Willem van Ewijk and cinematographer Jasper Wolf film the beautiful and terrifying expanse of the sea in glorious widescreen, capturing the transcendence and violence of Mother Nature, while simultaneously engaging with the subtle nuances of Fettah’s home life. “Freedom.

Since Davis had always assumed Ronald was an only child, he sends this odd, jittery character on her way, but then he stumbles upon a hidden artifact that proves she was telling the truth.

North Sudan’s racist war against Southern ethnic groups has displaced 1.5 million people living in fear of the regular bombing from the Ukranian-made Antonov planes. The heart-stopping attacks are contrasted with the communities remarkably coming together to celebrate life. Sudanese director Hajooj Kuka’s film treats his subjects as people, giving them a humanity rarely afforded in outsider-crafted docs. The music they create responds to their situation in deeply affecting ways with homemade instruments as the cornerstone of community gatherings. This music functions as diversion, but also solidifies a sense of cultural identity and instills a hope for what the future may bring. Beats of the Antonov is an exceptional documentary that effectively celebrates the evolving ethnomusicology in the Sudanese refugee camps and becomes an uplifting portrait of the resilience of oppressed communities.", image: "blbnv9pnmskcdzcd7nnv", video: "K797ysGoAt4", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/beats-of-the-antonov-x12381", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27129", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 65},

Buckley Jr. and Gore Vidal for a series of televised debates to air during the Republican and Democratic national conventions. Buckley was a leading light of the new conservative movement, the founder and editor-in-chief of its ideological masthead, “National Review.” His polar opposite, Gore Vidal, was a leading leftist polemicist and a bestselling novelist, whose recently published novel “Myra Breckinridge” had become a controversial sensation. Neither man much cared for the other’s reputation or politics, but when they finally met before the cameras this distrust became a vitriolic enmity. Live and unscripted, the pair’s bombastic exchanges, which often degenerated into vicious ad hominem attacks, made for compelling viewing, and the ratings skyrocketed. Co-directed by Robert Gordon and Academy Award®-winner Morgan Neville (Twenty Feet From Stardom, SIFF 2013), Best of Enemies vividly recounts the pair’s debates—a highbrow blood sport that would serve as inspiration for the pundit television of today, influencing such programs as “Crossfire,” “Hardball,” and even “Siskel & Ebert.” ", image: "jkw7wdqplmqmat5ding6", video: "JSH20evwVIc", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/best-of-enemies", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=26967", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 87},

Serbian composer Aleksandra Vrebalov created the score, commissioned by the famed San Francisco string combo the Kronos Quartet and inspired by anti-war writings, music, and art created during and immediately after WWI. “I intended to juxtapose historical accounts of war with the finest expressions of spirit and creativity occurring at the same time,” Vrebalov said, his score using speech recordings, military commands, air-raid sirens, and musical excerpts from Bartók, Huelsenbeck, and Byzantine hymns. Director Morrison (2002’s Decasia), who has built much of his experimental and prolific filmmaking career combining rare archival material with contemporary music, has made brand new HD scans of these deteriorating, 100-year-old films.

From October to April a small team of brewers, ranging in age but all with a shared love for the drink, leave behind their families and live communally at the brewery in order to tend the sake 24/7. Such a commitment is awe-inspiring, and reflective of their obvious passion. Many breweries have moved to automatic and machine-run ways of creating this beloved beverage, and the Yoshida Brewery is one of the only ones left that follow the handmade, tried and true, time-consuming way. Yet saké’s popularity has gone down in recent years, as a result of a younger generation shying away from its stiff taste.

Such caricatures haven’t sat well with all their targets, of course, and many of the interviewees have tales to share of censorship, imprisonment, or worse. Not one of which, happily, has led any of these cartoonists to despair or silence. Instead, their determination to call out corruption and hypocrisy only seems strengthened by such attacks.

The media-savvy image was deliberately, provocatively militant, but the programs that mattered offered free breakfasts for hungry children and medical clinics for the poor; when the end came at the literally murderous hands of cops and the FBI, violent internal schisms played their part as well. So were the Panthers dangerous poseurs or inspirational, committed revolutionaries? Employing a host of commentators, director Stanley Nelson rejects such easy judgments, managing to capture all the contradictions. From Eldridge Cleaver’s exile and Huey Newton’s isolation to Hoover’s paranoia, from the liberating exultation young members felt in the party’s embrace of black beauty and power (“we had swagger,” one interviewee proudly recalls, and indeed they did) to the bitter despair when their worst fears of the forces aligned against them were repeatedly, bloodily exceeded, the film emerges as the near-impossible—a definitive portrait of a story so large and complex you’d have thought it could never have one.", image: "c7uopiqmy2pvkmsd4mzi", video: "GTRA9RW5AzU", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/black-panthers-vanguard-of-the-revolution", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27239", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 116},

After the first day’s big take, though, Abel finds his boda boda stolen, setting him on a frantic scramble through the streets of Kampala to get the bike back before it is stripped and sold for parts. Ugandan director Donald Mugisha (The Kampala Story, SIFF 2013) has taken De Sica’s The Bicycle Thieves as his inspiration to create a unique portrait of desperation filled with strong performances, a pulsing soundtrack, and an exceptional authenticity that makes audiences feel like they are amidst the calamity of this Ugandan metropolis.", image: "xqzdloms0xx6yi8zysaj", video: "MdV-nQ7laGE", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/boda-boda-thieves-x12396", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27165", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 85},
  {name: "Bodyslam: Revenge of the Banana", description: "Ronald McFondle. Kiwanis Adonis. Eddie Van Glam. While you may have never heard these names before, the fans of Seattle Semi-Pro Wrestling’s shows definitely have. For six years, the stars of Seattle SSP honored and parodied professional wrestling with their boozy blend of burlesque and athleticism. Packing bars throughout the city with their profane, rowdy performances, they quickly developed an equally rambunctious following—audience members regularly hurl (mostly) empty beer cans at their villains. Somewhere amid the headlocks and half-nelsons, this troupe of outsiders slowly evolved into an unorthodox family, bound together by their love of performing. When new performer Paul (a.k.a. The Banana) joined their ranks, SSP had high hopes for their recruit. But each side had very different ideas of what his role should be, and when The Banana decided that they’d really slipped up, he went for the ultimate takedown. Suddenly, the wrestlers were forced to take on their biggest foe yet in an all-too-real fight for the future of their organization. Co-directors Ryan Harvie and John Paul Hortsmann follow the battle from Seattle’s dive bars all the way to the state capitol, with Seattle Semi-Pro Wrestling going to the mat to save their family.", image: "lv6ab9orwyfo0bgfb3iq", video: nil, link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/bodyslam-revenge-of-the-banana", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=26845", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 86},
  {name: "Bonifacio", description: "Packed with action and romance, Bonifacio is a stirringly dramatic telling of the story of Andrés Bonifacio, a leader in the movement to liberate the Philippines from Spanish colonial rule in the late 1800s. This controversial figure is presented as a fierce fighter and brave leader, a loving brother and husband who endured great personal tragedy and sacrificed himself, all for love of his homeland. Anchored in present-day Manila, three high school students learn from a museum curator that the history they’ve been taught is incomplete at best, inaccurate at worst. Objects in the museum become windows to the past while the mix of time periods shows how a historical figure can continue to inspire in the modern world. Robin Padilla, an established star in the Philippines, brings a quiet dignity to his role as the philosophical and charismatic leader and later displays his action film experience in expertly choreographed battle sequences. Featuring an emotional score and sweeping cinematography, Bonifacio illuminates a historic figure with passionate relevance to our modern world.", image: "hurihbztve2zq7nfq5wj", video: "oY2szxw-Dr8", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/bonifacio", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27382", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 105},
  {name: "The Boss, Anatomy of a Crime", description: "This incredibly disturbing story, based on real events, follows the exploitation of newly hired butcher Hermógenes, and his trial after he murdered his boss in broad daylight. Having been filled with self-deprecation and feelings of uselessness ever since he was stamped “not apt” on his military papers because of his limp, Hermógenes finds promise when he moves to Buenos Aires and gets a job at a butcher shop. Sensing an opportunity to take advantage of his new hire’s naiveté, the owner of the shop, Don Latuada, puts Hermógenes in charge of another location, forcing him to work incredible hours, live in a tiny room in the back, and sell rotten meat by any means necessary. Latuada’s inhumane treatment eventually pushes him over the edge, and he ends up viciously murdering his boss in the middle of the day. This story is described via flashbacks during the controversial trial, where Hermógenes’ lawyer, Marcello Digiovanni, uses his investigation to reveal the horrible truths behind Argentinian worker/employer power imbalances, and exposes Latuada’s heinous mistreatment and manipulation. Bringing to the table a sense of his documentarian roots, director Sebastián Schindel crafts a neo-realistic drama with strong central performances that exposes a corrupt system.

  {name: "Boulevard", description: "Nolan Mack (Robin Williams) is, on the surface, happily married and professionally satisfied, living the American dream and content with his life. But what others don’t know, including his warm wife (Kathy Baker), is that Nolan is going through the motions of a life of tremendous sacrifice—closeted, isolated, unfulfilled, and lonely as can be. One night, Nolan meets a young hustler (Roberto Aguire) and, in a confrontation that fatefully changes his entire existence—comes face to face with the lie he’s been living. Powerful and entirely human, Boulevard tells the story of a man transcending patterns of pretending to embrace the person he truly is. Williams gives a fantastically subtle but stunning performance, heartbreaking in both the character’s nature and the fact it was one of the actor’s final roles. Boulevard is both a bittersweet swan song to Williams’ life and a reminder of the arsenal of beautiful talent he’s left behind.

  {name: "Breathe Umphefumlo", description: "Puccini’s “La Bohème” is given the South African treatment by the team behind 2005’s international hit U-Carmen Ekhayelitsha. Transposed from 19th-century Paris to a contemporary South African township and shifted from Christmastime to mid-June, Lungelo (Puccini’s Rodolfo) and his dormmates are dreaming of their big futures. During a frustratingly regular series of power outages, Lungelo is visited by a secretly consumptive Mimi who is in need of a candlelight and their meeting sparks a deep and passionate love accompanied by some of Puccini’s best-known music. The couple and their friends find themselves at a Youth Day celebration in which Zoleka (U-Carmen’s lead Pauline Malefane), a nightclub singer and femme fatale ignites an altercation which results in everyone being expelled from University. Director Mark Dornford-May and Cape Town’s Isango Ensemble have crafted another vividly entrancing opera tragedy with an African flair. The film production ably trades the Italian language for Xhosa and Puccini’s orchestra for a unique instrumentation of steel drums, voiced percussion, and vocal harmonies which flavor the drama and give the film a more intimate intensity. The excellent operatic cast is equally strong musically and dramatically with Malefane’s brassy performance of Musetta’s Waltz as a Jazz Trio is one of the film’s must-see scenes. Like U-Carmen, Breathe Umphefumlo brilliantly appropriates the cultural/political tradition of European opera while opening the international market to new African horizons.", image: "ismv7nrbtlwcqvurh61k", video: nil, link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/breathe-umphefumlo-x12401", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27037", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 89},

She finds it, or so she thinks, in multi-millionaire Smith Ohlrig, whom she marries after a whirlwind courtship. But despite their lavish lifestyle together and relocating to a posh manor home on Long Island, the marriage quickly grows into an unhappy one—Leonora despondent and bristling beneath the overbearing Olhrig's constant abuse. Unable to secure a divorce from Ohlrig, Leonora leaves, virtually penniless, for New York City, finding work eventually as a receptionist in a poor neighborhood medical clinic run by Dr. Larry Quinada (James Mason). However, after a brief reconciliation with her husband, she becomes pregnant, a situation Ohlrig exploits to force her to return to him despite Leonora’s intense and increasing love for Quinada. Director Max Ophüls’ sublime noir melodrama is a masterpiece of elegant craftsmanship, filled with his distinctive fluid camera work and signature interplay between shadow and light. 35mm preservation print courtesy of the UCLA Film & Television Archive.

Throughout the 1960s and 70s their films helped to popularize Wuxia swordplay and Kung Fu action in American grindhouses and on Saturday afternoon television, and with The Cave of the Silken Web, the studio produced one of their most fantastical films. The third film of four based on the classic Chinese novel \"Monkey,\" and a remake of Dan Duyu's 1927 film epic, it follows a traveling monk, Xuanzhang, and his three companion-protectors-Monkey, Pig, and Friar Sand-in their search for a missing scripture. However, this merry band soon wanders into the titular cave, which so happens to be inhabited by seven sexy spider demons. Spying the monk, this legion of lethal ladies concocts a plan to devour the monk's flesh-a feast that will grant them eternal life. Soon enough, both Xuanzhang and Pig are captured within the spider demon's web, leaving it up to Monkey and Friar Sand to rescue the hapless pair before the spider women can make their final banquet preparations. Exquisitely crafted, the film is a gorgeous fantasy filled with lush color cinematography, massive martial arts action, and an unforgettable musical number.

Nicknamed “Challat,” after the Gillette brand of razor, the attacker became a kind of folk hero to religious and social conservatives, punishing women for not dressing “respectfully.” As part of her exploration, Ben Hania interviews victims, prison guards, detectives, lawyers and ordinary citizens (some clearly fictionalized, others apparently real) and discovers technological innovations such as the Virgin-O-Meter and a videogame in which players must slash only women whose heads are uncovered.

The journey is treacherous and challenging, and Xuanzang must constantly avoid evil demons who try to eat him and his party, apparently in the hopes of gaining mortality.

Now 60, the actor has teamed with director Rolf de Heer for a third time (after 2002’s The Tracker and 2006’s Ten Canoes) to co-write and star in a hypnotically beautiful film that parallels his own troubled life and epitomizes the cultural dislocation that aboriginal people face in contemporary Australia. Title character Charlie lives in an alcohol-free community in Arnhem Land, Australia, and it is more than clear that his people’s traditional ways have been all but snuffed out by his country’s government, personified here by a friendly but literal-minded local cop Luke (Luke Ford). When Luke confiscates Charlie’s weapons (including a makeshift spear), however, the Indigenous Australian man boldly sets out for the Outback in an attempt to “go bush” and reclaim his roots, soon finding that the terrain and other fellow travelers and transients may be too treacherous for his aging body and spirit. Melancholy and unflinching yet lyrical and hopeful, Charlie’s Country is a semi-autobiographical tale about finding oneself, no matter what age.", image: "jpuoy3a5uzkwgboy8ek0", video: "Ly8_7Su4m4c", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/charlies-country", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=26880", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 108},

Would you be able to see eye-to-eye with your fuzzy friend, or would you constantly be at each other’s throats, trading vicious barbs over the quality of that day’s flavor of Friskies or the frequency of litter removal? In this black comedy set in such an alternate world, sassy tabby Leonard (voice of John Autry II) is at odds with human Shelby (Megan Hensley), whose own emotional problems limit her abilities to provide for the most basic of Leonard’s needs. But when she begins a relationship with kindhearted musician Nate (Matthew Grathwol), Leonard sees a brighter future for both him and his owner. To emphasize the film’s themes of communication, every cat onscreen is voiced by a deaf or hard-of-hearing performer, making for a unique cinematic experience and a commentary on the roles not often available to hearing-impaired actors.", image: "pn9lcovg2argw3ei71x2", video: nil, link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/chatty-catties", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27153", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 85},

Her judgmental peers have empty inner lives, boys her age bore her to tears, and her mother won’t stop haranguing her about her eating habits. When her best friend Merit (Getter Meresmaa) offers her a respite from their provincial town life for an extended hike in the Estonian countryside, Laura jumps at the offer, hoping that it will assuage her teenage ennui. Enter Joosep (Gert Raudsep), their scruffy, fortysomething tour guide, whose rough-edged demeanor initially rubs Laura in all the wrong ways. But as their journey through the peat bogs extends over several days and they find common ground despite their dissimilar upbringings, the two let their guards down, and Laura starts to feel the first pangs of love. A tender drama about the complications of becoming an adult—few films so effortlessly capture the awkwardness and enhanced sensations of adolescence—Cherry Tobacco is a quiet gem whose delicate screenplay co-written by married directors Katrin and Andres Maimik, unobtrusive cinematography by Mihkel Soe, and naturalistic acting add up to a welcomingly low-key affair.", image: "du01bjc4ucyoopzrvzmr", video: "WnZpFLHojwQ", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/cherry-tobacco", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27282", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 93},

However, Geng has an audacious plan to revitalize his crumbling city by transforming it into a tourist destination, with a world-class cultural center and a showcase for clean energy. But in order to do that, he’ll have to relocate 500,000 homes to make room for the restoration of the ancient city. Geng gives director Zhou Hao an unprecedented amount of access to this process, and Zhou takes full advantage of it, racing alongside the mayor as he calms protesters, chastises corrupt contractors, and fends off his wife’s increasing complaints about his workaholic ways. Shot in a breathless veritè style, The Chinese Mayor captures China’s hurtling rush toward modernism, while managing to be both small in scale and immense in scope; simultaneously an intimate character study and a panoramic glimpse of the challenges inherent in trying to navigate the deep divide between local Chinese politics and the party elite.", image: "a7sqxaxdfxjyw1rwkz5c", video: "GIRcpBEzO9o", link: "http://www.siff.net/festival-2015/chinese-mayor", purchase: "http://myaccount.siff.net/cinema/reserve.aspx?fid=345&id=27241", price: 13.0, host_id: 19, duration: 86},

Behind it all was the shadowy figure of Teodor Zamfir, the Godfather of illegal VHS tapes, who smuggled thousands of Hollywood movies behind the Iron Curtain, primarily genre films featuring stars like Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme. He hired a female translator, Irena Nistor, to watch the films and live dub them with Romanian narration, which she did with unprecedented speed and a growing infatuation with the art of cinema. Director Ilinca Calugareanu grew up attending these clandestine VHS nights, where friends would revel in stories of heroism and marvel at the lavish settings which featured such rarely seen symbols of freedom as fully stocked supermarkets and wild fashion trends. This nostalgic and thrilling documentary combines dramatic reenactments, interviews, and scenes from the best (and worst) of ’80s cinema to tell an inspiring tale of how movies really can change the world.
