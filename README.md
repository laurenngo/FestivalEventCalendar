# FSTVL

FSTVL is a personal planning companion for event-goers to use at events that are usually made up of a host of sub-events, such as festivals, conferences and conventions. It is built with both a consumer-type user (for the event goers) and an admin-type user (for the event hosts). As an event Host, you can add add events to your festival with descriptions, links, video trailers, etc. As an event goer, you can add favorite festivals, events, and manage your events on a personal calendar. You can also have friends, send messages and share your calendar with others.
